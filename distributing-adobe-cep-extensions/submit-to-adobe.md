## Submit to adobe 

Once you have a packaged and sign a Adobe CEP extension you can upload it to the Adobe Exchange marketplace.

Submit to[ **adobe exchange program**](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/creativecloud/appslist.html)**,** click **create listing**.

{% hint style="info" %}
in the **Notes & EULA** section of the submission form, it asks _Where To Find It ._ it seems like this is expecting something like instructions about how to load the extension in the Adobe Program such as `Window, Extensions, autoEdit2`
{% endhint %}
