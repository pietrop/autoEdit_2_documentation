# Distributing Adobe CEP Extensions

Can either

1. [submit to adobe ](submit-to-adobe.md)
2. [distribute as a zxp file](distribute-as-a-zxp-file.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
at the moment in packaging, ffmpeg and ffprobe static binaries, for the extension all binaries for all operating systems, linux, windows and mac are packaged within the app. 

The extension size is currently 275 MB . But by using [same logic as for the cross platform development with Electron](../appendix/ffmpeg-and-ffprobe-in-electron.md) it could be shrink down to 106 MB or so.
