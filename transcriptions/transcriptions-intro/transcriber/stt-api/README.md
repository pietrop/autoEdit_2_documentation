# STT sdks

## Component/part description

it was important for the transcriber to have the flexibility of working with different solution for Speech To Text.

Eg currently working with

* IBM Watson STT, 
* Speechmatics
* Gentle Open Source STT
* Pocketsphinx 

However in the future, could integrate with other providers such as speechmatics, Google, Microsoft Bing etc..
