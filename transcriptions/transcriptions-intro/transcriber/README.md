* [**STT sdk**](stt-api/) audio to STT API/Service, to receive time-coded transcription.

With Extra:

* **Speaker diarization** can either happen at the STT API level or as a separate module to be interpolated with the transcription.

And optional:

* **Srt parsing**. Allow srt as input. In case transcription comes from elsewhere. Can use module [srtParserComposer to refactor](https://github.com/pietrop/srtParserComposer)

* **Plain text as input**, if you already have the transcription, use something like Gentle to re-align and generate transcription json.
