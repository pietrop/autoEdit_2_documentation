# Transcriber

## Component/part description

This is the module responsible for generating the transcription, generally using a third party service or API such as IBM Watson one.

{% embed url="https://trello.com/c/7jSJ7Bc1" %}

It is composed of 2 main components

* [**Audio converter**](audio-to-video.md) Convert audio or video to audio specs for stt API

{% embed url="https://trello.com/c/1fLY5mLQ" %}

* [**STT sdk**](stt-api/) audio to STT API/Service, to receive time-coded transcription.

With Extra:

* **Speaker diarization** can either happen at the STT API level or as a separate module to be interpolated with the transcription.

And optional:

* **Srt parsing**. Allow srt as input. In case transcription comes from elsewhere. Can use module [srtParserComposer to refactor](https://github.com/pietrop/srtParserComposer)

* **Plain text as input**, if you already have the transcription, use something like Gentle to re-align and generate transcription json.
