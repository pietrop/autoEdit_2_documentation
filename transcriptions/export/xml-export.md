> Getting back to the “exporting from Final Cut, Premiere etc.” task @cubicgarden @cnorthwood @pietro - just stumbled upon bodymovin, an open source, actively developed After Effects plugin for exporting AE animations to open web formats: [https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) .
