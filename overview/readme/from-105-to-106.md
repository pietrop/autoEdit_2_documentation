See [video demo of earlier prototype](https://youtu.be/KaJqlHfb7Uw) `1.0.5`

![Paper-editing in v 1.0.6](../../.gitbook/assets/autoedit.1.0.6.png)

Initially speced out as a [REST API with sails](https://github.com/pietrop/autoEditSailsApi)

Current version is desktop app in backbone packaged in for desktop. But useful to see [API specs to get a sense of the OOD](https://github.com/pietrop/autoEditSailsApi/blob/master/notes/api_end_points_v2.md).

Still to be added properly in `1.0.6` is `annotations` and `tags`. There are selections but at the moment lacking key features of categorisation and search-ability.

Also still to be implemented in v`1.0.6` is the `projects` to group transcripts and `paper-edits` together.
