### **‚úÖNavigation**

* ‚úÖWhen you navigate to an interview it loads the clip associated into the source monitor \(user can replace the clip with a sequence or the correct project item manually if desired\)
* ‚úÖ If on 12.1 highlight the appropriate project item in the browser by selecting programmatically if possible
* ‚úÖ When user clicks a word:
  * ‚úÖ Moves playhead in source monitor to that point
  * êÑÇ and starts playing
* êÑÇ Option: stop playing after \(x\) seconds \(if checked will activate a setTimeout to do the scrub method of stopping playback -- can perhaps do programmatically to automatically end at end of nearest paragraph, or allow user to input a setting\)

### **‚úÖ add highlights selection from autoEdit to premiere**

The highlights for a transcription can be added to a new premiere video sequence programmatically.

### **êÑÇ add selection from autoEdit to premiere \(with in and out points\)**

in transcription view set inPoint + outPoint on selection or on word click.

Eg When you make new hilight it could set in and out on source monitor.

Or just Out of scope for this version, to be revisited in subsequent versions.

Coz once the clip is loaded in source monitor and the playhead moved to current time on word click. The user can do cmd + i and cmd + o to set the desired outpoint, and then there‚Äôs also a video editor short cut to insert \(with different type of inserts cmd +  , and cmd + .\) segment in between in and out into the active sequence  
or as a workaround for now can use  add highlights selection from autoEdit to premiere and clear highlights to make new selections etc..
