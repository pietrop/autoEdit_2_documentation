# Submit to Adobe

## Submit to adobe 

Once you have a packaged and sign a Adobe CEP extension you can upload it to the Adobe Exchange marketplace.

Submit to[ **adobe exchange program**](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/creativecloud/appslist.html)**,** click **create listing**.

{% hint style="info" %}
in the **Notes & EULA** section of the submission form, it asks _Where To Find It ._ it seems like this is expecting something like instructions about how to load the extension in the Adobe Program such as `Window, Extensions, autoEdit2`
{% endhint %}

## Notes

{% hint style="warning" %}
at the moment in packaging, ffmpeg and ffprobe static binaries, for the extension all binaries for all operating systems, linux, windows and mac are packaged within the app. 

The extension size is currently 275 MB . But by using [same logic as for the cross platform development with Electron](../../appendix/ffmpeg-and-ffprobe-in-electron.md) it could be shrink down to 106 MB or so.
{% endhint %}
