# QA Intro

This section is a list of QA steps to go through before each release. To be keep up to date with changes of each new release.

Here is a video demo of the main "Transcription" in v `1.0.5` use case: [https://youtu.be/4z143-nJlzs](https://youtu.be/4z143-nJlzs). Needs to be updated with v`1.0.6` paper-editing. But still relevant for transcription part.

The app should be downloaded on a mac OS X that does not have any [dependencies installed on the system, e.g. node, ffmpeg, etc... see here for full list](). Here is the [latest release](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/releases).

For any issues during the QA process please file in the [Github repo](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2) and assign to `pietrop`, tag them as `QA` and the version number eg `1.0.6`.

See [user manual](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit2-user-manual/content/transcribing.html) along side QA notes for visual representation of each state.
